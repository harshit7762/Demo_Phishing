Here I had done phishing manually.At first I had copied Facebook login page HTML code and edited it like that it will be redirected to the a
php file where it had been programmed that the data entered through HTML code will be copied in a text file named log.txt.I had launched all the file
through Wamp server where anyone who had been redirected to that server enters their email id and password in the Facebook login page will be redirected to 
it's original facebook profile and their email id and password will be saved in my text file log.txt which can be accessed and misused by me anytime.
